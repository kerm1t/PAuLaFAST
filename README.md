PAuLaFAST X86
(PCL+ImGUI+3d Gfx)
=====

A proper CMake project is setup for Visual Studio X86.

glew (and the Shader version of OpenGL) has been omitted for now.

However, PCL is currently for X86 (32Bit), so we need to change that.
Ok, that was simple, just getting the win32 version from GLfw's website (http://www.glfw.org/download.html) and rebuild.
